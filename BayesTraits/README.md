BayesTraits v4

BayesTraits v4 is required to run Step 3 of the pathwayPCM workflow
(phylogenetic comparative analysis using reversible-jump MCMC).

Due to licensing restrictions, the BayesTraits executable cannot be
redistributed within this repository.

Please download BayesTraits (version 4.0 or later) from the official website:

    https://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV4.0.0/BayesTraitsV4.0.0.html

After downloading, place the BayesTraits executable (e.g., BayesTraitsV4)
